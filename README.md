This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections within route handlers.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where an asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation`) might fail but lacks proper error handling. This can lead to the application crashing or behaving unexpectedly. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling, ensuring robustness and preventing crashes.
